# 🍕 Pizza Sales Dashboard & SQL Analysis
Hello,
My name is Osman Umut Kara. I am pursuing a career in Data Analysis and Business Intelligence. In line with this goal, I have been working on various projects to improve my skills.

I would like to share one of these projects with you.

This project aims to provide valuable insights to decision-makers by analyzing pizza sales data.
Using SQL Server, queries were executed on the sales data, and an interactive dashboard was created in Excel for visualization.

Through the dashboard, the following insights were obtained:

Peak sales days and hours

Best- and worst-selling pizzas

Sales distribution by category and size
